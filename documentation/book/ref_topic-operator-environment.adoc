= Topic Operator environment

When deployed standalone the Topic Operator can be configured via environment variables. 

NOTE: The Topic Operator should be configured via the `Kafka.spec.topicOperator` property when deployed by the Cluster Operator. 

`STRIMZI_RESOURCE_LABELS`::
The label selector used to identify `KafkaTopics` to be managed by the operator.
`STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`::
The Zookeeper session timeout, in milliseconds. 
For example `10000`. 
Default: `20000` (20 seconds).
`STRIMZI_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`::
The list of Kafka bootstrap servers. 
This variable is mandatory.
`STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT`::
The Zookeeper connection information. 
This variable is mandatory.
`STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.
`STRIMZI_TOPIC_METADATA_MAX_ATTEMPTS`::
The number of attempts for getting topics metadata from Kafka. 
The time between each attempt is defined as an exponential back-off. 
You might want to increase this value when topic creation could take more time due to its larger size (that is, many partitions/replicas). 
Default `6`.
`STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL`::
â€“ The level for printing logging messages. 
The value can be set to: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` and `TRACE`. 
Default `INFO`.

If the operator configuration needs to be changed the process must be killed and restarted.
Since the operator is intended to execute within a {ProductPlatformName} `Deployment`, this can be achieved by deleting the pod.
