= Changing a topic

This procedure describes how to change the configuration of an existing Kafka topic by using a `KafkaTopic` {PlatformProductName} resource.

.Prerequisites

* A running Kafka cluster.
* A running Topic Operator, either deployed by the Cluster Operator via the `Kafka.spec.topicOperator` property, or deployed standalone.
* An existing `KafkaTopic` to be changed.

.Procedure

. Prepare a file containing the desired `KafkaTopic`
+
.Example `KafkaTopic`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: orders
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  partitions: 16
  replicas: 2

TIP: You can get the current version of the resource using `oc get kafkatopic orders`.
+
NOTE: The `KafkaTopic.spec.topicName` cannot be changed because Kafka does not support changing topic names.
+
NOTE: The `spec.partitions` cannot be decreased, because Kafka does not support this.
+
CAUTION: Increasing `spec.partitions` for topics with keys will change how records are partitioned. If the topic uses semantic partitioning blah

. Update the `KafkaTopic` resource in {PlatformProductName}, for example:
