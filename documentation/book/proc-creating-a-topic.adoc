= Creating a topic

This procedure describes how to create a Kafka topic using a `KafkaTopic` {PlatformProductName} resource.

.Prerequisites

* A running Kafka cluster.
* A running Topic Operator, either deployed by the Cluster Operator via the `Kafka.spec.topicOperator` property, or deployed standalone.

.Procedure

. Prepare a file containing the `KafkaTopic` to be created
+
.An example `KafkaTopic`
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: orders
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster

NOTE: It is recommended to use a topic name that is a valid {PlatformProductName} resource name. Doing this means that it is not necessary to set the `KafkaTopic.spec.topicName` property. In any case the `KafkaTopic.spec.topicName` cannot be changed after creation.
+
NOTE: The `KafkaTopic.spec.partitions` cannot be decreased.

. Create the `KafkaTopic` resource in {PlatformProductName}, for example:
