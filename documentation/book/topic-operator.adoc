=== Usage Recommendations

. Either always operate on `KafkaTopic` resources or always operate directly on topics. That is, avoid routinely using both methods for a given topic.
. When creating a `KafkaTopic` resource:
    * Remember that the name cannot be changed later.
    * Choose a name for the `KafkaTopic` resource that reflects the name of the topic it describes.
    * Ideally the `KafkaTopic.metadata.name` should be the same as its `spec.topicName`.
      To do this, the topic name will have to be a https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md[valid {KubernetesName} resource name].
. When creating a topic:
    * Remember that the name cannot be changed later.
    * It is best to use a name that is a https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md[valid {KubernetesName} resource name],
      otherwise the operator will have to modify the name when creating
      the corresponding `KafkaTopic`.

=== Resource limits and requests

The Topic Operator can run with resource limits:

* When it is deployed by the Cluster Operator these can be specified in the ``Kafka.spec.topicOperator.resources` property.
* When it is not deployed by the Cluster Operator these can be specified on the `Deployment` in the usual way.

==== Minimum Resource Requirements

Testing has shown that the topic operator functions adequately with 96Mi of memory and 100m CPU when watching two topics.
It is therefore recommended to use these as a minimum when configuring resource requests and not to run it with lower limits than these. 
If the Kafka cluster has more than a handful of topics more generous requests and limits will be necessary.
